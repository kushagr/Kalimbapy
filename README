This python port uses a microframework called "Flask"

To setup Flask on your system follow the steps on http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/installation/#installation

After installation open up the terminal and fire up python
>>> from kalimba import init_db
>>> init_db()
>>> exit()

Run the server by typing "python kalimba.py"
and point the browser to localhost:5000

P.S. The fetching of data from Hackerstreet is extremely slow so you might have to wait for quite some time.
     Another thing once you start seeing the data fetched in the terminal close the server and restart it. Then 
     go to localhost again and you'll see the rendered page.
